  * If you got the Steam version on Windows this will look something like C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Victoria 2/mod
  * If you got a non-Steam version on Windows it might be something like C:/Program Files (x86)/Paradox Interactive/Victoria 2/mod

4. From the ZIP move everything into the mod folder.
5. Start the game, select the mods you want:
  * GFM is standalone - you do not need the original HFM to play.
